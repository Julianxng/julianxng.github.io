## Purpose
my research introduces the Bi-TILDA (Bi-thumberal Integrated Linkage Dexterous Anthropomorphic) robotic hand. 

The primary objective of this study is to investigate how a dual-thumb architecture can enhance robotic handdexterity, increase grasp stability, and expand the range of manipulation tasks. By exploring this novel design, this research aims to provide new insights into the design and application of dexterous robotic hands, particularly in the context of in-hand manipulation, and to overcome the limitations of traditional robotic
hands.

This project involved replicating the intricate structure, range of motion, and dynamic control of the human hand using custom-designed mechanical linkages, embedded systems, and sophisticated control algorithms.

This page contains a breif oversight of an incredibly complex project, full details can be found in the original paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wly0BfT6lK3g8eUGSQ55rkRpKhrYd5qc/view?usp=sharing)

## Key Objectives
- Replicate human-like dexterity and motion.
- Achieve real-time control for complex finger movements.
- Optimize for compact form factor and lightweight design.
- Integrate robust control algorithms for precise actuation.

## Design and Development
### Mechanical Design
The hand features a complex linkage mechanism replicating the natural biomechanics of human fingers. Utilizing SolidWorks for CAD modeling, stress analysis was conducted to ensure structural integrity under dynamic loads.

### Embedded Systems
Microcontrollers (Arduino and STM32) were employed to manage the control of 15 motors, encoders, and drivers, ensuring real-time response and precision.

### Control Algorithms
The control system integrates inverse kinematics models to map finger joint positions accurately. The algorithms handle real-time feedback for smooth and coordinated finger movements.

### Prototyping & Fabrication
The hand was prototyped using 3D printing technologies (FDM and PolyJet) and assembled with precision components to maintain the delicate balance between durability and lightweight design.
